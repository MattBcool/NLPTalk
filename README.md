## Features
* Backbone architecture for a Unity Metaverse simulation
* C# -> Python TCP socket connection interface for streaming encoded inference data
* Proposed a new NLP model for the use of Metaverse applications with many more potential applications
* Stream custom datasets using Apache Spark to train several statistical models including SNN, t-SNE, and LDA
